# GamingSimulations
## Explanation of the Project
The Project was a set of requirements that involved features such as AI pathfinding and flocking, using forces, collision detection and state-based behaviour. The way I saw best of doing this was to create games that targeted certain sections of the mark scheme. This meant that I had a hub world that had 4 games that could be accessed. 

The Project was split into 2 sections when marked by Newcastle University, therefore there is a scripts for part 1 section and a deprecated scripts section. I decided to keep these as some are used in the project but the deprecated scripts are there to show that I try to improve my work.
